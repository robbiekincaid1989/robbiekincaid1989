Hello! My name is Robbie and I love to program. I enjoy the problem solving that comes with that doman, and I love the feeling you get when you finally break through the wall that you've been smacking your head against!

I enjoy web development but I really want to get into desktop application development (probably through C#). I may even tamper with game development at some point.

I'm currently working my through an AAS with a concentration on programming. Software engineering is where I want to be one day and I can't wait to make it there!

You can reach me via my email address, or you can send a message on Twitter (twitter.com/robbitjuice). I look forward to meeting new people and creating awesome things!
